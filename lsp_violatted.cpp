//Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
//LSP is the L in SOLID principles.

//It states: Objects of a parent class should be replaceable with objects of its child classes without changing the correctness of the program.

//in simple words:If class B inherits from class A, then wherever we use an object of A, we should be able to use an object of B without breaking the functionality.

//A Fixed Deposit Account allows deposits but does not allow withdrawals. So it should not be forced to inherit an interface that requires withdrawal.
